Only one small barrel remains unbroken amid the rubbish."}

Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight."},

Channels run down either side of the path next to the cages, probably to allow the prisoners' waste to flow through the grates on the other side of the room. The cells appear empty but your vantage point doesn't allow you to see the full extent of them all."}
